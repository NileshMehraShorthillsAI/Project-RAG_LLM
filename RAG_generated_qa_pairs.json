        "question": "How does the paragraph describe the current state of sexual culture in India compared to its historical perception?",
        "answer": "The paragraph paints a picture of a complex and contradictory sexual culture in India. Historically, India is presented as a pioneer in sexual education through art, literature, and sculptures, with a general acceptance of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. The Kama Sutra is highlighted as an early example of \"Kama\" being treated as a science.\n\nIn contrast, the current state is described as marked by a \"very strong repressive attitude\" towards sex, particularly within the middle class, leading to sexual dysfunction in marriages. This shift is attributed to the impact of British colonialism and its policies, which significantly altered both legal and societal views on sexuality. The colonial era is seen as a turning point, contributing to the social control of women's bodies and the ongoing impact on social movements and politics surrounding gender and sexuality. While progress is being made, exemplified by the decriminalization of homosexuality in 2018, the legacy of the colonial era and societal attitudes continue to shape and restrict sexual expression in India today."

This act likely angered the Licchavikas.\n*   **Bimbisāra's choice of Vehalla as successor:** Bimbisāra had chosen Vehalla as his successor after Ajātasattu fell out of his favor. This preference further fueled Licchavi's support for Vehalla's claim to the throne.\n*   **Failed negotiations and hostilities:** Tensions between Licchavi and Magadha had been building, fueled by offences, Ajātasattu's actions, and the handling of the Koṭigāma border post.

        "answer": "Based on the provided text, here's why crop productivity is low in Chhattisgarh and its impact on farmers:\n\n**Reasons for Low Crop Productivity in Chhattisgarh:**\n\n*   **Monoculture:** A significant portion of the state's agricultural land (around 77%) is dedicated to rice cultivation, creating a monocrop system. This can deplete soil nutrients and increase vulnerability to pests and diseases, ultimately lowering yields.\n*   **Limited Irrigation:** Only about 20% of the agricultural area is irrigated, making the majority of crops reliant on rainfall. This dependence on rain leads to unpredictable yields, as rainfall patterns can be erratic.\n*   **Low Double-Cropping:** Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area is double-cropped, indicating a lack of intensive land use and potential for increasing overall production.\n*   **Lack of Diversification:** Few cash crops are grown in the state.\n*   **Inefficient Food Distribution System:** The Indian food distribution system faces challenges due to heavily regulated movement of agricultural produce.\n\n**Impact on Farmers:**\n\n*   **Reduced Income:** Lower crop yields directly translate to lower incomes for farmers, who are heavily dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.\n*   **Economic Vulnerability:** Reliance on a single crop and rain-fed agriculture makes farmers highly vulnerable to weather-related risks, market fluctuations, and pest infestations.\n*   **Food Security Concerns:** Low productivity can affect the state's ability to meet its own food needs, and can also impact the livelihoods of farmers by reducing the price of their crops.\n*   **Limited Economic Growth:** As agriculture is a major contributor to the state's economy, low productivity hinders overall economic growth and development.\n*   **Need for diversification:** Farmers need to diversify agricultural produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops.\n\nThe text suggests that Chhattisgarh needs to address these issues by promoting crop diversification, improving irrigation infrastructure, and encouraging double-cropping to increase productivity and improve the economic well-being of its farmers."
