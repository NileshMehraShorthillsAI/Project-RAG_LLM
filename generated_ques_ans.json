However, Kalhana's narrative is noted to be excessively exaggerated, and in the absence of other corroborating sources, the authenticity of the raids and other events must be disputed. Jayapida married Kalyanadevi, daughter of King Jayanta of Cooch Behar, whilst away in a conquest. Returning to Kashmir, he found his brother-in-law Jajja to have usurped the throne but went on to defeat him. Kalhana notes his later years to be tyrannical when Jayapida sought to (unsuccessfully) rescind agraharas and imposed a cruel taxation regime on Brahmins, forcing them to emigrate; he was cursed to death by a Brahmin."
